# thoughts
sleep situation only got worse, not sure what the hell is going on.

# work
goal is get a lot done today, but given how it's started off... i'm not sure
about how that will play out.

tasks:
- more cs461 notes
- work on cs461 programs, assignments
- work on cs449 program
- cs420 notes

# non-work
nah

# exercise
given the trash sleep i've gotten these past two days, i don't think i really
should lift. i am kinda scared of doing harm to my muscle recovery and general
progress as i enter the 2.5ish month point in my lifting regiment. i might try
running and seeing if that can tire me out on top of th exhaustion i'm already
feeling.
