# thoughts
unfortunately very long week. gabby and i have been exploring housing options
in KC along with possible work office spaces and have concluded everything
sucks. i might just get my own loft so we, in effect, have our own office
spaces, but for now we are trying out a very-very large book shelf as a office
partition to help add some privacy, noise absorption, and work-life separation
for both of us.

covid19 and a failed national response really have made the situation way more
difficult and frustrating than it would otherwise be since a coffee shop or a
public desk at some workspace would suffice for what we need and would be
cheaper by an order of magnitude.

# work
week was mostly defined by outlining work on dux, cross checking ggg, and the
things i need to do between both of them to flesh out a sane and functional
parser for PDF-1.7

# non-work
recently discovered bioshock 1 and 2 were remastered in HD and got them on
sale. played through bioshock 1 along with most of mass effect 1 this week
along with watching more football to pass the time.

# exercise
nothing but walks with pius. if i get my own space, maybe i could finally get a
weight rack but who knows. im mostly coping and making excuses for not figuring
out an exercise schedule, though.
