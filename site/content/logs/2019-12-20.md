# work

put more work into learning rocket and the "port" i am making of the python
flask mega-tutorial by Miguel Grinberg. managed to figure out templating with
tera from within Rocket and wrote some on that.

also cleaned up my org files, took inventory of things i might want to study aside
from stuff like rocket.

# non-work

played some games on the switch and read economist/bloomberg/blogs.

# exercise

made sure to take pius out for a few walks as mental breaks and enjoy the
weather, contemplate my existence.
