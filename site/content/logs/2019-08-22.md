# work
- worked on more anki cards - i'm starting to build a sizeable collection of
  them, very happy about this.
  - in particular, i'm focusing on rust and general data structure terms. it's
    very good for helping to cement trickier concepts or patterns, which i like
    a lot. the process of writing good cards in of itself is a healthy exercise
    in learning as well.
- worked on ferrisp for rust belt rust
  - this is going to start taking more and more of my time, as i would prefer
    to front-load on this now in the semester for a lot of different reasons.
  - today i worked on the lexer/parser/ast. since i'm using nom for now, which
    is a bit of twist compared to a traditional toy programming language, i'm
    juggling how i'm going to integrate this in the workshop smoothly.
    - i think using/teaching nom is worth it, i really do. the question is how
      i am going to communicate this and demonstrate this to the audience and
      then make sure they can get up and going with it quickly along with other
      things.
    - worst case i default back on to a normal scanner to lex and tokenize, but
      i'm hoping i can come up with write-ups, documentation, and demo code
      that makes that not necessary.
      
# non-work
- aired up my tires, they've been needing it.
  - one tire has a slight tear/loss of rubber on the side(?) which
    blows... they are new tires. it is not significant, but i will need to keep
    an eye on that.
- got some groceries
- did some reading

# exercise
- ran ~4mi of 0.5mi intervals with gabby, ~9min/mi on the fast ones, ~12min/mi
  on the slow ones.
  - really nice weather and run.
