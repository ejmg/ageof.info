# thoughts
i am falling behind on some things. i think i need to redouble my efforts on
anki cards, both my writing of them and reviewing. while this is largely for
job prep, i think they would be very useful for cs461 and cs420 due to the
extensive amount of vocab, of sorts, in those classes.

i am running behind on where i would like to be with some class notes. this is
only going to get harder in the next two weeks because of conferences, so i
really need to buckle down hard here.

# work
- math301 notes
  - i got through most of ch1 and ch2, but want to get through a good chunk of
    ch3 still.
- math300 notes
  - i still want to get ahead of class

# non-work
read more baudrillard, looked into how i can get an rss feed going with a
workflow/application i would like.

# exercise
i ran a 3.48mi run @ 8:04min/mi.
