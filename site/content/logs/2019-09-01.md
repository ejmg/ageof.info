# work
got mired once again by more administrative things, but this was a mistake of
my own design. i forgot to book housing for strange loop and proceeded to lose
2-3 hours in the search for, and (thankfully) booking of a cheap airbnb that is
*somewhat* close to Peabody. at this point, i am either going to be forced to
commute everyday to SL and pay for daily parking (i really don't want to do
this) or bring my bike so i can learn what cycling through downtown St. Louis
feels like. i really think i'm going with the latter unless weather squares up
to be horrible, not workable.

other than that, i also:
- worked on ferrisp
- organized and planned out more stuff in my agenda, org files
- planned out stuff for the proto-PapersWeLove group i'm organizing for KC.
  - i'm really excited about this and am cautiously optimistic. i really want
    to believe KC can sustain the long run attendance/involvement for such a group.

# non-work
i met up with some really old friends and ate some wings with them fairly late
into the evening. i don't think the people comprising my social circle were
ever intended to survive this long, but for those of us still here, we are
still trying.

i also read some baudrillard before bed.

# exercise
i lifted as per schedule:
- squats: 5x5 @ 55lb
- over head press: 5x5 @ 45lb
- dead lift: 1x5 @ 105lb

i think i need to work on my dead lift form, it no longer feels natural as it
did when i was last lifting consistently. primarily, i need to work on how i
execute it when i go back down after each lift.
