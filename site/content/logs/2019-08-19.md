# work
- classes began, had cs449 and cs420 today. i really hope for the best, particularly with cs420 which is networks.
- worked on anki cards, also worked on an org-capture template that should
  make, well, making anki cards easier as i can quickly knock them out while
  reading something in emacs or on the web.
  - also found a bug with anki-org, which was already filed. seems an upstream lib for using libcurl introduced a (seemingly avoidable...) async bug.
- knocked out an exercism.io problem, i think i might go with that over hackerrank. we'll see.

# non-work
- read some more of both hands-on data structures and algorithms with rust **and** feeling good.

# exercise
- ran a really good 5k. intervals of 0.5 between a ~8:00min/mi pace and ~9:00min/mi pace.
