# work
- looked at job prep stuff and starting formulating some kind of routine for
  prep between anki cards and problem sets to look at.
- also cleaned out my org mode master file, got it ready for classes and this
  school/professional year generally.

# non-work
- read some of that Feeling Good book with Gabby, i really like thus far and
  somewhat implicitly affirms my priors about stoicism as a general life
  philosophy. call it cliche, but since high school i can recall believing that
  stoicism was due for a comeback because of what i saw/felt coming with
  respect to technology, social media, and economic uncertainty. i
  unfortunately think hs me was right 8 some years later.

# exercise
- relaxed, no workout. starting to think that i shouldn't take off days,
  though. my body is really accustomed to the stress relief/outlet provided by
  some kind of arduous workout, so maybe always at least run 2-4mi even if at
  very slow pace? idk.
