# thoughts
an uneventful but productive day. foggy with a mix of sleet and rain through the afternoon.

# work

## PDF-1.7
i managed to finally finish up the sections most pertinent to working on `ggg` and `dux`,
i.e. ยง7.1-3, ยง7.5, ยง7.7, and ยง7.9. i doubt these will be the only parts of the standard i'll be
spending serious time on, but they are definitely the most relevant ones to start with. i want to
find a way to exercise this knowledge more, so maybe a small blogpost or something would suffice - i
hate reading huge sections of a technical resource/document and not doing something more with it
aside from context knowledge for work.

## bit fiddling
along with finishing up the stuff i wanted to read/review out of the standard, i did more fiddling
with actual pdf files and their construction. [Bless](https://github.com/afrantzis/bless/) continues
to be a great tool and seems to fit my use cases for navigating and figuring out byte offsets in a
timely manner. [pdftk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/) is another tool i started to
experiment and that is fairly well known for this sort of work, but much of my tinkering had me
desiring better documentation of the functionality and its logic; i.e., i will probably need to look
at its source to figure out how it decides to conform to the standard with things like EOL markers.

# non-work
i had the sudden and overpowering urge to re-experience the mass effect trilogy of games. i don't
know why i'm the way i am, but i am much more inclined to replay games i enjoyed rather than try
knew ones. anyway, i have something new to look forward to over the winter.

# exercise
more small upper body exercises and not much at that. really failing here and it's upsetting.
