# thoughts
i think i'm in a small funk. not sure what to do other than double down on
working out, tbh. it's the one thing i've done less of recently and it
correlates pretty heavily with how i feel about myself, and general
mood. school and other commitments increasing in intensity doesn't help either,
but also all the more reason to work out judiciously.

# work
Tues/Thurs block of classes remains a monolith of time to work around. need to
get better at that.

aside from classes:
- started working on another zola theme for giggles, possibly for a side
  writing project i might pickup for fun
- got ipython/jupyter books working with rust thanks to google's kickass [rust
  kernel](https://github.com/google/evcxr/tree/master/evcxr_jupyter)
  - heavily consider writing up a small PR to explain how to get it working for
    those of us who don't regularly use IPython, Jupyter notebooks..

# non-work
slow day, to be honest.

# exercise
squeezed in some lifting before classes, thinking i might switch it to after
classes to help get the brain going as i've mentioned before:
- squats: 5x5 @ 50lb
- benchpress: 5x5 @ 45lb
- barbell rows: 5x5 @ 65lb

minor concern i need to work on my form with barbell rows and overhead press
(last session), but I honest to god think it might have to do with general
weakness with my core/back muscles. last time i lifted consistently, i recall
these things getting better with time. i also did my best to make my benchpress
take time despite being relatively easy at 45lb. long, slow repetitions in
order to better workout those support muscles so i'm less shaky, "jerky"
motion.
