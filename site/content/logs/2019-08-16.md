# work

did some self-care and cleaned up my emacs config a tiny bit, synchronized it
with changes from over the summer. started looking at hands-on data structures
and algorithms with rust again.

# non-work

finally got my passport figured out; that was a small saga to go through but
the paperwork and money is all submitted and paid.

# exercise

ran ~3.5mi at a ~9:30min/mi. felt good, but tiring. i think i am hitting a
small wall and need to throw some intervals into my training again.
