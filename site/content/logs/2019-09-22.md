# thoughts
didn't sleep well last night.

# work
did a lot of notes for cs461. it goes without saying, but i am continuously
disappointed by the quality of textbooks out there. i find it negligent, imho,
that the text failed to go into greater depth over how algorithmic analysis
works wrt factors of inputs used for artificial intelligence related
algorithms, problems.

i also worked on some programs.

# non-work
i played some link's awakening for the switch. i really enjoy the art style.

# exercise
nothing. i worked the day before, though.
