# thoughts

it's been a long time once again since i've done a public log, trying to see if
i can fight back into the habit given everything else i've been working on.

# work

spent most of the day working on a rust web application that i've been slowly
hacking away at for most of july. this is something i've spent time on aside
from things like studying react and doing job prep otherwise.

# non-work

i spent the early morning updating my dot-agenda and getting it setup to use
again in addition to my org-mode workflow.

# exercise

not today, but i have plans to start running again tomorrow. it's been about 2
weeks since my last run but, in my defense, i had a gnarly pain in my Achilles'
heel that felt like muscle strain from running too hard. i'll be sure to take
it slower this week.
