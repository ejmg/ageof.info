# work
- checked out aws cli and what that looks like for automation with s3, but not
  much else.

# non-work
- wrote a blog post.
- went to the nelson atkins and saw 30 Americans, discovered a new personal
  favorite artist, [Jean-Michel
  Basquiat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Michel_Basquiat). not to be
  dramatic, but i don't think there is any other artist whose work i more
  closely appreciate as of my discovery. his bird on money piece was a pleasure
  to see in real life.
