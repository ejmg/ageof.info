# thoughts

past few days have all been absorbed the holidays; i spent all day on xmas eve
making albondigas for my family's dinner/celebration - it was a hit, and none
was left by the end. the dinner itself was great - a packed house at my
abuela's plus the friends i invited over made for a great time despite the
absence of other family members. xmas day was similar spent with
family/friends, though this time with gabby's family out in kansas. overall
very relaxed and happy times these past few days.

# work

i've been working on the Rocket app stuff a lot over the past few days,
holiday's aside. honestly, this has involved a lot of reading on my end to
understand things like CSRF, CORS, HTTP, etc in a web-development context
better, but especially in the context of a systems programming language like
Rust.

i already have the skeleton for a hand-rolled anti-CSRF system programmed out
in my app + the concurrency/multi-threaded stuff that will be required for
opting to make it myself as opposed to shoving it into a dbs of sorts.

also trying to get a coffee related job at bway given how much time i already
spend there + needing some extra cash this semester.

# non-work

a good amount of reading and some hanging out with friends.

# exercise

haven't gotten back into the groove yet, but christmas eve aside, i have been
doing pretty well with fasting again. first meal is at 12:00 with no eating
till my second meal at around 18:00-19:00, and then repeat.
