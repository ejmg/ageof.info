# thoughts
having some difficulty waking up in the mornings which is par course as we move
closer to winter proper. being inside all the time really doesn't make things
better, honestly

# work (including yesterday)

## PDF-1.7/ISO-32000-1:2008
sigh - i am still working through the standard. feels like i've lost some
momentum these past two days which may just be a function of time for any
person working through any non-trivial standard. or... i'm being unnecessarily slow.

as of today, i'm nearly done with file structures which will leave me document
structure (ยง7.7) and data structures (ยง7.9). at that point, i believe i'll have
a good starting point to work around PDF's base syntactic structures. from
there, i can start to work with letitia's prototype bnf and see what i can make
of out of it into a ggg based grammar.

at some point i will need to deal with PDF-2.0/ISO-32000-2, which might make sc
joining the pdf association a good idea, if only for a year, to get a hold of
ISO documents for both PDF-2.0 but also for PDF/A if that becomes any sort of
interest for the duration of our SafeDocs work.

## internal comms
hoping to get a matrix server and client going for sc soon so that we can have
a more coordinated means of communication for both SafeDocs work but also
bridge and other projects.

# non-work
nothing special today but more x files with gabby, some work on this website,
and maybe some reading.

# exercise
this morning we took pius on an extended walk around midtown and gabby bought
some hand weights along with a pull-up/push-up bar that i did some reps
with. i'm weighing the idea of a 24/7 gym membership that i can use at the
crack of dawn (i've seen it at 5am, no one is there...) while wearing my
respirator vs buying a half squat rack for the apartment.
