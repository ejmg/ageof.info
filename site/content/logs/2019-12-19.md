It's winter break but I felt productive by the end of the day, i think.

# work

I worked on learning more rocket and finished the paste.rs tutorial on the
website + taking some general notes on the framework.

I cleaned up my org mode files a good amount, as well.

I also looked around at the things I can try studying for job prep between now
and ????.

# non-work

Finally, I took Pius on another long walk and tried to enjoy the relatively
nice winter weather. We took a break to play fetch during the walk and Pius had
a blast.

# exercise

I re-started my intermittent fasting routine. Fasting over the summer was one
of those things I discovered to work very well for me. I never feel bloated or
"""fat""" as a result, which is really nice (hard to describe otherwise how I
feel comfortable, not distracted by the act of my literal existence). By
dinner, I was starving... but I prevailed nonetheless.
