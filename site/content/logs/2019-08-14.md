# work
- read up on docker, CI/CD, and makefiles. i want to use these tools more often
  and i'm going try them out with this website as a test.

# non-work
- not much, lax day. somewhat foggy feeling because of the drinking last night
  at the concert. i just don't think my brain cares for alcohol in any amount
  past two or three drinks; i always feel cloudy and overall meh the next day.
- may or may not have bought a physical copy of okasaki's purely fp data
  structures along with another promising book on compiler construction.

# exercise
- got annoyed because of computers, decided to put that into a hard run. nailed
  a ~8:15min/mi pace on my 5k despite staying up late previous night, feeling
  somewhat gross from the drinking/food.
