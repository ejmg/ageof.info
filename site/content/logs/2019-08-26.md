# work
got quite a bit done:
- math301 hw
- math300 notes
- wrote more anki cards for data structures, algos

# non-work
- did some organizing for a potential [papers we love
  chapter](https://paperswelove.org/) here in kansas city.
  - i got a group of ~8 people right now who say they are interested, we've all
    converged on a good set of dates/time for when this could work. plan on
    getting the word out to my department/uni ACM in some way or another, also
    might try getting it to the AskADev group I meet with every other weekend.
  - i really would enjoy having something like PWL in KC. i think this captures
    the type of community/professional development i want more of wrt KCMO.

# exercise
lifted for the first time again today:
- squats: 5x5 45lb (bar)

it's going to be a long fall/winter for lifting.
