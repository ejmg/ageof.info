# work
- got my blog setup and running with gitlab's CI/CD integration for
  github. it's really nice being able to commit new content, like this log, and
  gitlab automate the deployment to aws s3. it feels a little bit
  overengineered given the code hosting is on github, the ci/deployment is on
  gitlab, the actual static hosting is on s3, and the dns stuff is cloudflare,
  but altogether i really like the infrastructure behind my website.

# non-work
- made headway on passport stuff, should be handled soon.

# exercise
- ran 4mi, felt fairly tired about .5mi in going @ ~9min/mi pace, so i just
  targeted my heart rate for remainder.
