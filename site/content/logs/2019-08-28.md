# work
not a very productive day for me. i had difficulty getting up, but once i was
up and about:
- [ ] checked over math301 homework, caught several errors in logic.
- [ ] researched some stuff for a project i am thinking about doing
- [ ] read up on some design and architecture stuff with respect to APIs, websites

# non-work
read some baudrillard, continue to really enjoy *Utopia Deferred*.

# exercise
no workout. was still sore and i opted, at least this time, not to do a run at
minimum. it hurts knowing i am reducing my fitness, but i'm hoping the strength
training will more than payoff.
