# work
- read more h.o.d.s.a.
- worked some more on ferrisp
    - i think i'm going to truck on with current impl, but i might revisit the idea of using `delimited` as a combinator.
    - i feel like it will be a little "magic"-y for attendees, but it is more performant AND it actually embraces more the idea of a AST proper

# non-work
- started a rough draft for a blog post i've been thinking about for a while
- read some economist
- hungout with some friends from out of town

# exercise
- today was the first time i tried biking to/from school, and it was fun and
  great and all that, but i really did underestimate the impact 30lb of
  backpack would have on me lol.
  - also, kc commuters keep me on constant edge, yikes yikes yikes
