## PDF-1.7
finished off the file structure part of ยง7, moved on to document
structure. only have that and data structures left afaiac for having at least a
base to work with when plotting out this parser. that said, getting a hold of
ISO-32000-2:2017 does seem important at this point because i can already see
areas where the syntactic and semantic differentials will, goes without saying,
be rather significant.

## Bytes
i also spent a good amount of time after finishing 7.5 looking into and playing
around with hex editors because i want to be able to explore PDF files more
effectively. Finding byte differences quickly for object references, etc, is
more or less critical for basic sanity checks. hexyl didn't feel good enough
for this use case, but Bless seems surprisingly robust and a good fit for what
i need.

# non-work
more x files and that was about it, honestly

# exercise
gave the dog a nice long walk in the morning with gabby, did some minor lifting
exercise with the weights gabby bought.
