# thoughts
i feel okay, but am simultaneously really stressed out. i don’t know the path
forward in order to finish all the things i need to, or, alternatively, the
path that at least best optimizes for what i need to get done.

without being too on the nose, the other problem is to fight off the constant
instinct to procrastinate in the face of that stress. it was the best of times,
it was the worst of times.

# work
i finished the linear algebra stuff i needed yesterday. this still leaves me
with plenty to do. in order of what i probably should do today:

1. cs461
   - notes
   - assignments
2. math301
   - notes
3. cs449 notes
4. cs420 notes


# non-work
non.

# exercise
i will be lifting later tonight. assuming successful, sets will be:
- squats: 5x5 @ 85lb
- ohp: 5x5 @ 55lb
- dead lift: 1x5 @ 135lb

i have no clue how i’m at 135 for dead lifts already.
