# work
aside from classes:
- cs461 notes.
- did some agenda/planning stuff.
- met up with cs449 group to discuss upcoming project, timeline, outline
  deliverable, and figure out what things we need to know before our next
  meeting.
  - also talked about our tech stack. i think we are really going to try and
    see if we can get a solution involving rust working using neon to interface
    with js/browser.

# non-work
- checked out pocket more as a solution for organizing things i want to read.
  - next up is to checkout elfeed for emacs so i can setup rss for blogs i want
    to keep track of.

# exercise
none today outside of commuting to/from uni on my bike. doing this consistently
is going to definitely give me some quads given the hills in kc.
