# non-work
i finally gave in and bought Pocket, used it for saving some papers i want to
read later. not much else here.

# exercise
lifting:
- squats: 5x5 60lb
- bench: 5x5 50lb
- barbell row: 5x5 70lb

i am also trying to commit to riding my bike to uni instead of using my
car. there is a stupid amount of traffic around the parking garage such that if
you get there at peak leaving/before class, you can literally get stuck
entering/leaving the garage for about ~15 minutes in of itself. it's moronic
and i basically snapped, there's no reason to ride my bike; who cares if i'm
sweaty, less carbon and it's a good workout at ~4mi total, back and forth. it
worked out today, aside from minor leg exhaustion (having lifted before going
to school) and aforementioned sweat.
