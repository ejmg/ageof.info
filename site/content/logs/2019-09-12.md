# thoughts
how do you catch yourself in the downward slump before inertia pulls you down?
i wish i was better at that.
# work
felt ill, i think a got a stomach bug or food poisoning, whatever gabby got
yesterday, probably.. today was kinda of a reset as well.
# non-work
watched some netflix, don’t do much of that anymore. can’t help but feel guilt
for not getting anything done, to be honest.
# exercise
before i got hit with that bug, i lifted:
- squats: 5x5 @ 80lb
- bench: 5x5 @ 60lb
- row: 5x5 @ 80lb
