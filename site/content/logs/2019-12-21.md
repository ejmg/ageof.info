# work

read up a bit on csrf and what that might look like wrt implementing with
Rocket. not going to lie, a bit confusing/overwhelming given that the
implementation of anti-csrf protections comes in like 3-5 different
forms. might be worth it to make a very small crate that achieves the
functionality i need.

# non-work

ate bfast with abuela, mom, gabby. afterwards, helped abuela put up her
christmas tree and then gave her dog a bath because she asked at the last
minute (lol). was good to see her and talk with mom.

# exercise

nothing significant, still focusing on getting in the flow of intermittent
fasting again and then going to re-introduce running/lifting again.
