# work
today i kinda just chilled out a bit. i went to class and did some
administrative things i felt needed to get done but other than that, nah, not
much.

# non-work
watched dave chapelle's new special, read some news, and whatnot.

# exercise
no exercise today. i think i'm finally at the point where i can (and thus
should) run on the days i'm not lifting. no more excuses!
