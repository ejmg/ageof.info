# work
hit on a lot of things today:
- math300 notes
- math301 notes
- math301 homework, halfway done on that
- worked on ferrisp
  - debating to what degree i should clean up the lexing. i want it to be
    easily traceable, but there are also probably some better choices i can
    make in combinator logic that would make the code more efficient without
    losing much in terms of readability

# non-work
- today was largely spent working, not much else.

# exercise
- skipped out on running, but plan on introducing lifting back into my schedule *tomorrow*
