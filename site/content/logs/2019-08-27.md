# notes
T/TH are turning out to be the days I'll have difficulty getting anything done
on outside of classes. with class at 10am, that leaves me with not much time to
get anything done in the morning, and i'm not out and done by 2:30ish. it's
hard not to be brain dead after that, so maybe I should consider integrating my
workout for these days for **after** classes, such as to give my brain and body
some oxygen and good'ol physical strain to wake up and focus.

# work
aside from classes:
- figured out travel plans for RBR
- contacted professors about my absences re: RBR, Strange Loop
- got some math300 notes done

# non-work

picked up baudrillard again, his collected writings from Utopie are proving to
be a real hidden gem. getting another copy after losing the first book was worth it.

his analysis of political activism, intellectualism remains disturbing in its
prophetic nature. surely the protests of may 1968 invoked his analysis with
deserving accuracy, but it is hard to wrap my brain around the fact he is not
talking about **today**.

# exercise

i was way too sore lol. i'll probably be just sore enough tomorrow (if not
more, second day tends to be worse), meaning i'm going two days w/o exercise,
not happy about that. maybe i'll try taking some extra long walks to make up for it.
