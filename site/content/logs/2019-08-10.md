# work
- figured out how s3 and cloudflare work, was a partial migraine inducing
  affair because of (not knowing) cloudflare's option to bust its cache.
- more blog work, found some small edge cases with styling for tablet
  devices. i think it only effects my personal customizations because of my
  margin offset and not the base theme itself.

# non-work
- not much!

# exercise 
- rest day
