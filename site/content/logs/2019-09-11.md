# thoughts
hard to describe what this week has been like. the feeling is stuck between two
dichotomies, on one extreme, an infantile inability to handle and come to terms
with the tasks on hand. on the other, a desire to completely reject the
proposition as it stands. i feel like i’ve put more work than ever into the
things i care about and yet it won’t be enough so long as i keep having to deal
with other messes constantly.

i’m tired and i could have done better this week. a lot better. i won’t be
attending strange loop because of it all, and i’m not all that happy.

# work
i have a lot of things to do, for those who might not have caught that from
above. past week was unfortunately wasted, more or less. yeah.

# non-work
∅

# exercise
through my mess, i’ve at least stuck to my workout regime. i’ll be lifting
again sometime tonight or tomorrow morning.
