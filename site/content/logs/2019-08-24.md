# work
- worked on math301 hw
- read math300 text, did notes
- wrote some anki cards

# non-work
- hungout with friends, did brunch

# exercise
- ran 4mi @ 7:58min/mi pace. wasn't intending to do that, especially when i
  already had cotton mouth and a lead stomach 0.5mi into the run, but lo', i
  ran probably my best 5k in 4 years.
- not exercise, but i guess it could go here(?): i got stupid anxious towards
  the end of the day despite working out, etc, and i had difficulty shaking
  it. it made sleeping iffy, so i don't know what to make of it.
