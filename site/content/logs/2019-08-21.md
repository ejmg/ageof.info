# work
- read h.o.d.s.a. for about 1.5 hours or so, along with writing code with
  it. [open sourced that](https://github.com/ejmg/hodsa) for other people to
  look at, i guess.
- started ch1 of my networking book
- wrote quite a few anki cards, particularly wrt rust.
- made a [small PR](https://github.com/wezm/read-rust/pull/94) to read-rust,
  which is a very cute idea/website.

# non-work
- thought about some things to write about. it doesn't feel like work, but
  maybe it is.
- read some of the economist. trying to build a habit of getting back into
  recreational, i.e. non-technical reading, but yet again i think other people
  would consider my interest in finance and economics anything but, uh,
  relaxing ðŸ˜¬
- got a good salad at the mixx with gabby

# exercise
- did not work out. got up a bit late + was pretty tired by 9PM, so just opted
  not to.
