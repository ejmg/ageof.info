# thoughts

it's been a tough month. being cooped up inside 24/7 is really starting to get
to me. so it goes.

# work

apparently i will be submitting a paper to langsec's conference as a part of
IEEE's security and privacy symposium. it has to do with PDF's, no surprise -
really, the fact i am coauthoring something right out of college, let alone
something covering formal methods is the surprise itself. i have no clue what
i'm doing, dear reader.

i've also got my company up on matrix now, and work on `dux`, my ggg based PDF
parser will begin proper this month.

# non-work

gabby and i continue to work through the x files. we're at season 4 now. i've
also made a thing out of playing through the megaman x series along with a few
other video games here and there.

if you call it "not working", i'm also starting to work through baudrillard's
bibliography for fun.

# exercise

i really, really, really, really miss weight lifting. i really miss it. a lot.
