# work
- went to AskADev kc, talked about what i've been doing, talked with corey
  about what he should/should not do with the group now that he wants to move
  away from the AskADev brand/national-org.
- also spent some time looking at ways to do more job prep given i'm
  graduating, totally not filled with dread and paralysis over the issue, no
  sir.
  
# non-work
- pretty boring day, played some videogames and hungout with gabby

# exercise
- ran 3.5mi of intervals in the morning, averaging a pace of ~9:00min/mi
  flat. the intervals were 0.25mi each, except for last 0.5 which was race
  pace. cooldown intervals averaged around 9:00-10:00, faster intervals varied
  between 7:30-8:15. felt good, was challenged.
