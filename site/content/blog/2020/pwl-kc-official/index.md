# four, going on five

when i first started pwl kc 4'ish months ago, i didn't know long it would
survive as a group. at our first real meeting, we decided as a group that pwl
kc would be in a sort of "test drive" mode and that nothing would be made
official until ~3 or so meetings were successfully organized *and* with modest
attendance (~6 minimum). as of that meeting, we have successfully held four
presentations, and, on the 21st of this month, we'll be holding our fifth.

consequently, i formally opened the [PR requesting chapter status and pwl
obliged](https://github.com/papers-we-love/organizers/issues/71). pwl kc is now
set up as an official chapter ðŸŽ‰.

Hedon and myself are the formal organizers (still looking for one more!), our
meetings have thus far always held a healthy number of attendees (6 or more),
and each meeting has been delivered by a new presenter; i would consider pwl kc
very successful if we can manage to hold those numbers for more than a year -
anything else would be frosting on the cake.

aside a few TODO's left to check off (setting up a meetup.com/eventbrite page,
maybe a small gh hosted webpage, and filling out the README on the official
repo), there's not much left with respect to setting up this "official"
organization. the lax nature of pwl is actually a very appreciable facet of
it - the participants tend to be individuals who may or may not be in a
transient phase in their lives as software engineers - so keeping the
organization uniform, but very minimal, seems to be a strong model for such an
org. all you need to really do is have a love for learning cs/ce/swe and a
respect for your fellow scholars.

on that note, i invite anyone who reads this to our next meeting on tuesday,
the 21st of january. we'll be hearing a presentation by Natty, who did a
semester's reading project on GAN's with respect to music generation.
