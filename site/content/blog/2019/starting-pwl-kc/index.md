this past tuesday marks (what might turn out to be) kc's first [papers we
love](https://paperswelove.org/) chapter meeting. i donâ€™t have much to say here
other than i am really appreciative of those who came out to give feedback for
how/where/when it should be ran. our next meeting is scheduled for **september
17th**, so please come out if you want to learn about computer science (and
other things) with friends ðŸ™‚.

as of now, based on the feedback and discussion at our first meeting:
- we meet **every other tuesday** at **7:00PM** at the **south kc plaza public library**.
- no one really likes FB as an organization/communication channel, and there
  isnâ€™t much excitement for meetup.com either.
  - until we can see if something like telegram or signal group chats work, we
    might defer to meetup.com for at an easily discoverable online presence.
  - i am simultaneously going to look at solutions like GetTogether, which is
    ~FOSS version of meetup.com.
- weâ€™re going to stick with the traditional PWL format, i.e. one person per
  meeting will have a paper to present.
- we have a good idea of what papers make good candidates and even discussed
  ones that we might cover sooner rather than later.

*it is worth noting that this group remains unofficial.* while we will abide by
the PWL code of conduct, i am refraining from forming an official chapter with
PWL proper because i want to make sure a chapter is feasible in the long run
for kcmo. the group agreed on this general view and roughly with the litmus
test iâ€™ve presented: if the group can reliably meet with a healthy number of
attendees (i put this at 6 minimum, preferably ~10) for around 3 months, then i
think it has the *capability* to survive without overly invested organizers
(i.e. other "founding" members and myself). i am cautiously optimistic, but kc
is ultimately a commuter town, which makes organizing interest groups
particularly hard from what iâ€™ve seen with other organizations. a huge percent
of workers commute in and out of the suburbs, and the moment the clock hits 4PM
it often a race back home to beat traffic.

for our first meeting, only 3 other people showed up. to those of you (Natty,
Noah, Hedon), i am particularly thankful. iâ€™m also very happy to say that hedon
is more than willing to join on as an organizer, which makes my job easier by a
whole order of magnitude. the headcount for the next meeting is much more
promising at around 8-10 people with this past tuesday a glaring exception to
the surveyed availability due to conferences and previous plans.

we also already have a paper chosen out for the 17th. hedon will be presenting
on "[Magic: The Gathering is Turing
Complete](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09828)", a fun and novel paper to get this
group started. â¬›
