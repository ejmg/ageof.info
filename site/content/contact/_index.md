## contacting[^1]

i think email is still underrated. you can contact me at either address as of now:
- <elias.jm.garcia@gmail.com>
- <elias.jm.garcia@pressmail.ch>

if chat is more your thing, you can reach  me on telegram with
`@eliasjmgarcia`.

## where you can find me in cyberspace

you can typically find me as `ejmg` or `eliasjmgarcia`. some that may be of immediate interest:
- [github](https://github.com/ejmg)
- [keybase](https://keybase.io/ejmg)
- [twitter](https://twitter.com/eliasjmgarcia)
- [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ejmg)

despite the numerous friends and connections i made on twitter, i gave up my
active twitter presence around a year ago or so.

## where you may have met me in physical space

- strange loop conf @ 2017, 2018
- icfp @ 2018
- rust conf @ 2018
- rust belt rust conf @ 2018, 2019 <soon>
- a coffee shop in midtown kc, mo

[^1]: for whatever odd or precarious reason, if you feel neither email nor telegram
are secure enough:
- message me on keybase
- use my gpg key([here](../ejmg.asc) or
  [here](https://keybase.io/ejmg/pgp_keys.asc))
- we can coordinate to talk over signal
