## hola

my name is elias julian marko garcia, and i am software engineer with a b.s. in
computer science from [umkc](https://sce.umkc.edu/).

people have described my background and demographic as non-traditional for
computer science.

## my interests

...are varied. you will probably find me reading about or working on projects
involving:
- programming languages and PLT
- systems programming
- software design and safety
- computational social science
- history, political economy, and cliometrics

in a previous life, i studied financial, monetary, and institutional
economics. maybe one day i'll give these topics the focus they deserve.

if you've read this far, you may be interested in my [cv (of
sorts)](../assets/pdfs/cv.pdf).
