## hola

my name is elias julian marko garcia, and i am a senior at
[umkc](https://sce.umkc.edu/) studying computer science with a minor in
mathematics. i graduate in may of 2020.

people have described my background and demographic as non-traditional for
computer science.

## my interests

are varied. you will probably find me reading about or working on projects involving:
- programming languages and PLT
- systems programming
- software design and safety
- computation social science

in a previous life, i studied financial, monetary, and institutional
economics. a lot has changed since then and so have i, but my passion for these
topics have only grown more intense. maybe one day i'll give them the focus
they deserve.

if you've read this far, you may be interested in my [cv (of sorts)](assets/pdfs/cv.pdf).
