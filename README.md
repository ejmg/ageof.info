# my blog

this is my blog. specifically, this is like the third incarnation of it. 

this time round i decided to use [zola](https://getzola.org), and its theme is
based of off [zerm](https://github.com/ejmg/zerm), which is a hugo port i
made. there are quite a few customizations i've made to it, and i'm not
convinced they're all that good, so use at your own risk.

## building

install zola and clone this theme, then:

```
cd ageof.info/
mkdir themes
cd themes/
git clone git@github.com:ejmg/zerm.git
cd ..
zola serve # or build if deploying somewhere
```

## misc

1. i don't particularly recommend anyone to use my webdev code as an example, it's not pretty

2. this was the repo i originally fleshed out zerm, so there's some gunk in
here that isn't relevant anymore but that i've yet to clean out. please don't
mind my bytes ðŸ‘».
