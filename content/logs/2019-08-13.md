# work
- knocked out a bunch of errands today, things like grocery shopping and working on the sink
- started re-applying for passport; a hellish experience given that i lost my previous one, it seems. 

# non-work
- went to a This Will Destroy You concert in westport. they were absolutely
  amazing live and i was front and center the entire time, arms reach from
  everyone in the band minus the drummer.

# exercise
- ran ~3.5mi in the morning, ~11min/mi pace. something brisk but not too fast,
  though i really need to start crunching on pace again.
