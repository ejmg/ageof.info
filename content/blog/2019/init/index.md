# return code `0`

I've decided to remake my blog, yet again, after intermittent years of
writing. A part of this has to do with the forking paths I find myself slowly
approaching: with the end of university, things like job hunting, future living
arrangements, and figuring out what I want to do with myself, professional and
otherwise, sit constantly at the front of my mind. *Naturally*, remaking my blog
using a new stack of technologies[^1] is a natural coping mechanism to all of
this.

Jokes aside, the other major motivation for restarting this endeavor is that
I've found myself increasingly want to write again, but particularly on things
technical. The past two years have been hectic but in recent months I've found
myself with more free time and more things I want to write about, especially as
I play with tools and concepts I've been wanting to learn outside of university.

Consequentially, here sits this site, born again in cyberspace. I've stripped
away the past, abandoning years of my old writing[^2] - it isn't much relevant
anymore and I don't care for carrying its weight any longer - and, with a clean
slate to write on, hope to start anew. I might pull an item or two from the old
version of ageof.info, those pieces lost between this form and my first blog,
but for now I view this medium with a clear focus looking forward. For those
reading, I hope you find it worth your time.

[^1]:I ported/forked a theme from Hugo so I could use it on zola and now depend on cloudfront and S3 for my hosting. I got tired of Jekyll's build times and Raspberry Pi's struggling with intermittent power outages, it turns out.


[^2]:besides, they sit safely on an old wordpress.
