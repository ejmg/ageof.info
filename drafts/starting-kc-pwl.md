this past tuesday marks (what might turn out to be) kc's first [papers we
love](https://paperswelove.org/) chapter meeting. i donâ€™t have much to say here
other than i am really appreciative of those who came out to talk about details
of what exactly this organization will look like and giving feedback for
how/where/when it should be ran. our next meeting is scheduled for **september
17th**, so please come out if you want to learn about computer science (and
other things) with friends ðŸ™‚.

as of now, based on the feedback iâ€™ve thus far gathered:
- we meet **every other tuesday** at **7:00PM** at the **south kc plaza public library**.
- no one really likes FB as an organization/communication channel, and there isnâ€™t much excitement for meetup.com either.
  - until we can see if something like a telegram or signal group works, we
    might defer to meetup.com for at least a easily discoverable online presence.
  - i am simultaneously going to look at solutions like GetTogether, which is
    ~FO SS version of meetup.com.
- weâ€™re going to stick with the traditional pwl format, i.e. one person per
  meeting will have a paper to present.
- we have a good idea of what papers make good candidates and even discussed
  ones that we might cover sooner rather than later.

this is nothing official, however; i am refraining from forming an official
chapter with PWL proper because i want to make sure such a chapter is feasible,
in the long run, in kcmo. the litmus test iâ€™ve presented for myself and others
is that if the group can reliably meet with a healthy number of attendancees (i
put this at 6 minimum, preferably 10) for around 3-4 months, then i think it
has the *capability* to survive for an extended period of time and without
overly invested organizers (i.e. me and other starting members). i am
cautiously optimistic, but kc is ultimately a commuter town; it makes
organizing interest groups particularly hard as a huge percent of workers
commute back to the suburbs as quickly as they can come 5pm.

for our first meeting, only 3 other people showed up. to those of you (natty,
noah, hedon), i am particularly thankful. iâ€™m also very happy to say that hedon
is more than willing to join on as an organizer, which makes my job a lot
easier a whole order of magnitude. the headcount for the next meeting is much
more promising at around 8-10 people (this past tuesday was a glaring exception
for the surveyed availability) and we already have a paper chosen out. hedon
will be discussing "[Magic: The Gathering is Turing
Complete](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09828)", which i think will be a fun and
enjoyable way to kick this group off. â¬›
